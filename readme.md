Perfect Storm

Perfect Storm is an orthogonal collection of disruptive technologies.

I intend to centralise these on github, but do have other code on codeplex (https://perfectstorm.codeplex.com/) and bitbicket (https://bitbucket.org/chriseyre2000/perfectstorm).

Currently the github project includes a simple azure wad log viewer application.

The code migrated from codeplex version also includes:

xslt code generation tool
queriable domain model
rules engine
pub sub framework

But these have not yet been upgraded to use the more recent .net framework.
